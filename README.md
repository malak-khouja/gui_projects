# GUI Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python GUI applications built with Tkinter. Each project demonstrates different aspects of GUI programming and practical application development.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Calculator (`calculator.py`)
A fully functional calculator application with a clean graphical interface.

**Features:**
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Number pad interface (0-9)
- Clear button to reset calculations
- Responsive button layout
- Expression evaluation

**How to run:**
```bash
python calculator.py
```

### 2. To-Do List (`To-Do list.py`)
A task management application to organize your daily activities.

**Features:**
- Date tracking
- Top priorities section
- General to-do items
- Reminders section
- Scheduled tasks
- Notes area

**How to run:**
```bash
python "To-Do list.py"
```

### 3. Data Analysis Dashboard (`dataanalysisdashboard.py`)
A simple dashboard for loading and analyzing CSV files.

**Features:**
- CSV file loading interface
- Data import functionality
- Built with pandas for data handling
- User feedback via message boxes

**How to run:**
```bash
python dataanalysisdashboard.py
```

**Note:** Requires a CSV file (e.g., Titanic-Dataset.csv) to analyze data.

### 4. Quiz App (`quizzapp.py`)
A quiz application framework (currently under development).

### 5. Other Files
- `fenetrederemplacement.py` - Additional GUI component
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py` - Temporary code execution file

## Requirements

### Python Version
- Python 3.x

### Dependencies
Install required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas
```

**Core libraries used:**
- `tkinter` - GUI framework (comes with Python)
- `ttk` - Themed Tkinter widgets
- `pandas` - Data analysis (for dataanalysisdashboard.py)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install Python 3.x if not already installed
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
4. Run any project using Python

## Usage

Each project is standalone and can be run independently. Simply execute the desired Python file:

```bash
python <project_name>.py
```
